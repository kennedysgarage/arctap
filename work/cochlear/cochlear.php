					<h2>The Concept</h2>
					<p>Meet <a href="http://www.aaron.im">Aaron</a>, a normal guy in his twenties, married to an awesome cochlear implant audiologist, with a kid on the way. He does most of his hobby work on his iPhone, and he also happens to be deaf. Currently Aaron is equipped with Cochlear Nucleus 5 and has to carry around a bulky remote to adjust the settings. Aaron never understood why the remote could not just be on his iPhone, so he decided to mock one up.</p>

					<h2>Strategy &amp; Approach</h2>
					<p>We decided that most Cochlear users already felt comfortable with the basic layout of the remote and that would be a good starting point for the design.</p>
