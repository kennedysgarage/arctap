				<h2>The Concept</h2>
				<p>Meet Aaron, a normal guy in his twenties, married to an awesome cochlear implant audiologist, with a kid on the way. He does most of his hobby work on his iPhone, and he also happens to be deaf. Currently Aaron is equipped with Cochlear Nucleus 5 and has to carry around a bulky remote to adjust the settings. Aaron never understood why the remote could not just be on his iPhone, so he decided to mock one up.</p>
