                            <p>In your first consultation meeting, you'll meet with Kennedy, ArcTap’s founder and UX Strategist, along with a person in development, design, and account. We'll talk about your goals and probably do a bit of a quick, top-of-the-head brainstorm with you, then get back with you on process, timing, and fees. ArcTap’s team members are all freelance, which is great for your budget as the cost of retaining a full-time staff is never passed on to you. Instead, we charge a weekly rate to allocate a team 100% to your project. You'll never share your ArcTap team with another account, so that we can stay dedicated and on top of your project. Additionally, our flexibility allows us to work on your schedule, even if you need something turned around in a time crunch.</p>
